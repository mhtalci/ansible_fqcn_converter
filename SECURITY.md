## Reporting a Vulnerability

The FQCN Converter team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities using one of the following methods:

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with detailed information
4. Submit the report

#### 2. Email Report

Send an email to the project maintainers with the following information:

- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability`
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact assessment**: Your assessment of the potential impact
- **Suggested fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

#### 3. Private Issue

If the above methods are not available, you can create a private issue by:

1. Creating a new issue in the repository
2. Marking it as confidential (if the option is available)
3. Using the `[SECURITY]` prefix in the title

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include as much of the following information as possible:

#### Required Information

- **Vulnerability Type**: What type of vulnerability is it? (e.g., code injection, path traversal, etc.)
- **Component**: Which part of the codebase is affected?
- **Severity Assessment**: Your assessment of the severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish by exploiting this vulnerability?

#### Optional but Helpful Information

- **Proof of Concept**: A minimal example demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
- **References**: Links to relevant security resources or similar vulnerabilities
- **Environment Details**: Python version, OS, and other relevant environment information

2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. **Investigation**: We will investigate the issue and develop a fix
4. **Coordination**: We will coordinate with you on disclosure timeline
5. **Resolution**: We will release a fix and publish a security advisory
6. **Recognition**: We will acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

The FQCN Converter project implements several security measures:

#### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with `bandit`
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies with `safety`
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of user inputs
- **Safe File Handling**: Secure file operations with proper permissions

#### Development Security
- **Secure Development**: Following secure coding practices
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates of dependencies
- **Access Control**: Limited access to repository and release processes
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials

#### Infrastructure Security
- **CI/CD Security**: Secure build and deployment pipelines
- **Container Security**: Security scanning for container images (if applicable)
- **Supply Chain**: Verification of build artifacts and dependencies

### Security Guidelines for Contributors

If you're contributing to the project, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Code Contributions
- **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **File Operations**: Use safe file handling practices
- **Dependencies**: Only add necessary dependencies from trusted sources
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials

#### Testing Security
- **Security Tests**: Include security-focused test cases
- **Fuzzing**: Consider fuzzing inputs for robustness
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error paths
- **Privilege Testing**: Test with different permission levels

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop fixes
3. **Coordination**: We coordinate disclosure timeline with reporter
4. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose after fixes are available
5. **Recognition**: We acknowledge security researchers (with permission)

### Disclosure Timeline

- **Standard Timeline**: 90 days from initial report to public disclosure
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: May be disclosed sooner if actively exploited
- **Complex Issues**: Timeline may be extended for complex vulnerabilities
- **Coordinated**: Timeline coordinated with reporter and affected parties

### Public Disclosure

When we publicly disclose a vulnerability, we will:

1. **Security Advisory**: Publish a GitHub security advisory
2. **Release Notes**: Include security fixes in release notes
3. **CHANGELOG**: Document security fixes in CHANGELOG.md
4. **Notification**: Notify users through appropriate channels
5. **Credit**: Acknowledge the security researcher (if desired)

## Security Resources

### For Security Researchers

- **Scope**: This security policy applies to the FQCN Converter codebase
- **Out of Scope**: Third-party dependencies (report to respective maintainers)
- **Recognition**: We maintain a security researchers acknowledgment section
- **Bounty**: Currently no bug bounty program (may be added in the future)

### For Users

- **Updates**: Keep FQCN Converter updated to the latest version
- **Monitoring**: Subscribe to security advisories for notifications

## Legal

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission
- Do not access or modify others' data
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and in good faith
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue

### Responsible Disclosure

By reporting vulnerabilities to us, you agree to:

- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue
- Not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have addressed it
- Not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
- Act in good faith and avoid causing harm to the project or its users
