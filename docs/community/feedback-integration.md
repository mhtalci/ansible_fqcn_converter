# Community Feedback Integration

This document describes how community feedback is collected, processed, and integrated into the FQCN Converter roadmap and development process.

## Overview

Community feedback is essential for the success of FQCN Converter. We have established multiple channels and processes to ensure that user needs, feature requests, and suggestions are properly captured and considered in our development planning.

4. **Resource Requirements**: Development effort and maintenance cost
5. **Community Support**: Level of community interest and contribution potential

**Scoring Matrix**
| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| User Impact | 30% | X | X * 0.3 |
| Strategic Alignment | 25% | X | X * 0.25 |
| Technical Feasibility | 20% | X | X * 0.2 |
| Resource Requirements | 15% | X | X * 0.15 |
| Community Support | 10% | X | X * 0.1 |

**Decision Process**
- **Score ≥ 4.0**: High priority, consider for next minor release
- **Score 3.0-3.9**: Medium priority, consider for future releases
- **Score 2.0-2.9**: Low priority, add to backlog
- **Score < 2.0**: Decline with explanation and alternatives

### Roadmap Adjustment Process

**Trigger Conditions**
- Significant new user requirements identified
- Major technical constraints or opportunities discovered
- Community feedback indicates misaligned priorities
- External factors (Ansible ecosystem changes, etc.)

**Adjustment Workflow**
1. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze proposed changes on current commitments
2. **Stakeholder Consultation**: Engage key community members and contributors
3. **Resource Reallocation**: Adjust team assignments and timelines
4. **Communication Plan**: Prepare community communication about changes
5. **Documentation Update**: Update roadmap and milestone documentation
