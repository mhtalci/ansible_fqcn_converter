# Community Feedback Integration

This document describes how community feedback is collected and integrated into the FQCN Converter development process.

## Feedback Channels

### GitHub Issues and Discussions
- **Feature Requests**: Use issue templates for new functionality
- **Bug Reports**: Report issues and problems
- **Discussions**: General questions and community conversations
- **Roadmap Feedback**: Input on priorities and timelines

### Community Surveys
- **Quarterly Surveys**: User satisfaction, feature priorities, pain points
- **Annual Survey**: Project direction, long-term needs, community health

### User Interviews
- **Monthly Interviews**: Deep dive into use cases and requirements
- **Focus Groups**: Collaborative design for major features

### Community Events
- **Monthly Calls**: Updates and feedback sessions
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Roadmap discussions
- **Conference Participation**: AnsibleFest and DevOps events

## Feedback Processing

### Collection and Triage
1. **Categorization**: Feature request, bug, enhancement, question
2. **Priority Assessment**: Critical, high, medium, low
3. **Effort Estimation**: Small, medium, large, extra-large
4. **Stakeholder Assignment**: Product owner, technical lead, community manager

### Analysis and Evaluation
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Feature request voting, user impact assessment
- **Qualitative Analysis**: User stories, pain point identification, workflow impact

### Roadmap Integration
- **Monthly Reviews**: Assess new feedback and adjust priorities
- **Quarterly Planning**: Comprehensive roadmap updates with community input

## Feature Request Evaluation

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **User Impact**: Number of users affected and severity of need
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Fits with project vision and goals
3. **Technical Feasibility**: Implementation complexity and constraints
4. **Resource Requirements**: Development effort and maintenance cost
5. **Community Support**: Level of community interest and contribution potential

### Decision Process
- **Score ≥ 4.0**: High priority, consider for next minor release
- **Score 3.0-3.9**: Medium priority, consider for future releases
- **Score 2.0-2.9**: Low priority, add to backlog
- **Score < 2.0**: Decline with explanation and alternatives
