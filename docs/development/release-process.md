# Release Process Documentation

This document outlines the complete release process for the FQCN Converter project, including version management, quality gates, and deployment procedures.

## Overview

The FQCN Converter follows semantic versioning and uses automated CI/CD pipelines for consistent, reliable releases. Our release process ensures high quality, comprehensive testing, and proper documentation for each release.

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Version Examples

```
0.1.0  - Initial production release
0.1.1  - Bug fix release
0.2.0  - New features added
1.0.0  - First stable release with API guarantees
1.1.0  - New features in stable API
2.0.0  - Breaking changes requiring migration
```

### Pre-release Versions

For development and testing:

```
0.2.0-alpha.1  - Alpha release for early testing
0.2.0-beta.1   - Beta release for broader testing
0.2.0-rc.1     - Release candidate for final testing
```

# Create hotfix branch
git checkout v0.1.9  # Last known good version
git checkout -b hotfix/0.1.10

# Apply minimal fix
# ... make necessary changes ...

git commit -m "fix: critical issue in conversion logic"
git tag v0.1.10
git push origin v0.1.10
```
