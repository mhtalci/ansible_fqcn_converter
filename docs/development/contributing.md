- **Community**: Issue triage, user support, code review

## Development Process

### Workflow
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes following code standards
4. Add tests and update documentation
5. Submit a pull request

### Setup
```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fqcn-converter.git
cd fqcn-converter

# Set up development environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` for new features
- `fix/issue-description` for bug fixes
- `docs/description` for documentation updates

## Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 with 88-character line length (Black)
- Use type hints for all public APIs
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Follow existing patterns and conventions

### Quality Tools
```bash
# Format code
black src tests

# Sort imports
isort src tests

# Linting
flake8 src tests

# Type checking
mypy src

# Security scanning
bandit -r src
```

### Commit Messages
Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Example:
```
feat(converter): add support for custom validation rules

- Add CustomValidator abstract base class
- Implement plugin system for validators
- Add comprehensive tests for validator plugins

Closes #123
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- Minimum 95% coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for core conversion logic
- Comprehensive edge case testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=fqcn_converter --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/
```

### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest
from fqcn_converter import FQCNConverter

class TestFQCNConverter:
    def test_convert_content_success(self):
        """Test successful content conversion."""
        converter = FQCNConverter()
        content = "- package: {name: nginx}"

        result = converter.convert_content(content)

        assert result.success
        assert result.changes_made == 1
        assert "ansible.builtin.package" in result.converted_content
```
